# MindMirror

This repository contains the MindMirror project — a Vite + React front-end located in the `mindmirror/` folder.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd mindmirror
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

Notes

- The top-level folder contains a `mindmirror/` app scaffolded with Vite. If you prefer working from the repo root you may adapt the commands accordingly.
- If you want me to add a more detailed README (screenshots, architecture, contribution guide, or commands for Docker/GitHub Actions), say what you'd like and I will extend it.
